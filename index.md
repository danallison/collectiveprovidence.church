# The Church of Collective Providence

The Church of Collective Providence is a pragmatic spiritual community founded on 3 core beliefs.

1. With dedicated practice, it is possible for ordinary people to become as enlightened as the Buddha and as loving as Jesus Christ. The upper limits of spiritual growth for ordinary people are much higher than typically assumed. The key is practice.
2. With the right organizing principles, it is possible for a collective of ordinary people to give rise to a unified group mind and coordinated group body.
3. With a commitment to reciprocity, it is possible for such a group body-mind to become more than the sum of its parts, more capable of providing for the needs of the group members than the members would be as separate individuals. This is collective providence, and this is the central focus of our community.
